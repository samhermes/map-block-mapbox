Embed maps on your site using Mapbox

== Description ==

Adds a map block to the WordPress editor, which can be used to display the location of your business, favorite restaurant, or the spot where you saw Debra Messing in person!

The map block uses Mapbox GL, so maps display brilliantly on your site. After installing the plugin, you'll need to connect a Mapbox account. For most sites, Mapbox's free tier will be plenty, but be aware that there is a limit. You can monitor your usage in the Mapbox dashboard.
